You can easily create a live preview of "[language]\abakt_manual.xml" in your browser.
The advantage is that you don't have to run AurigaDoc every time you change abakt_manual.xml.

Instructions:

- Copy the contents of directory "res" to the directory of your language (for example, to "en").
- Open "[language]\abakt_manual.xml" in your browser (for example, "en\abakt_manual.xml").

 
How it works:

Be sure that the second line in abakt_manual.xml is this:
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="../xml2html.xsl"?>
The stylesheet (.xsl file) is from AurigaDoc.

The browser automatically translates the xml file using the instructions in the xsl file.
Tested with Firefox.
